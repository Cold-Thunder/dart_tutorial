/// Row and column are the two essential widgets in Flutter that allows developers
/// to align children horizontally and vertically according to our needs.
///
///Key Points
/// 1 => Row and Column widgets are the most commonly used layout patterns
///      in the Flutter application.
/// 2 => Both may take several child widgets.
/// 3 => A child widget can also be a row or column widget.
/// 4 => We can stretch or constrain a particular children's widget.
/// 5 => Flutter also allows developers to specify how child widgets can use
/// 6 =>  row and column widgets' available space.
///
///
/// Properties:
/// We can align the row's children widget with the help of the following properties:
///    1 => start: It will place the children from the starting of the main axis.
///    2 => end: It will place the children at the end of the main axis.
///    3 => center: It will place the children in the middle of the main axis.
///    4 => spaceBetween: It will place the free space between the children evenly.
///    5 => spaceAround: It will place the free space between the children evenly
///         and half of that space before and after the first and last children widget.
///    6 => spaceEvenly: It will place the free space between the children
///         evenly and before and after the first and last children widget.
///
///
/// Row Widget:
///     This widget arranges its children in a horizontal direction on the screen.
///     In other words, it will expect child widgets in a horizontal array.
///
///
/// Column Widget:
///     This widget arranges its children in a vertical direction on the screen.
///     In other words, it will expect a vertical array of children widgets.
