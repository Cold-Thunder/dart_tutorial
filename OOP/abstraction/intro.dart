/// Concrete Class: We can create object of this type of class.
/// Abstract Class: We can't create object of this type of class.
///
/// abstract class is that class that can't be initialized.
/// It is used for defining behaviour of a class that can be inherited by other class.
/// abstract keyword is used for defining.
///
/// Syntax:
/// abstract class ClassName{
///       Method1(); ///abstract method
///       Method2();
///       Method3();
///       }
///
/// abstract methods are methods that declare without implementation
/// Abstract methods don't have body part.
///
///
///
/// Key Points To Remember
///  => You canâ€™t create an object of an abstract class.
///  => It can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
///  => It is used to define the behavior of a class that other classes can inherit.
///  => Abstract method only has a signature and no implementation.
