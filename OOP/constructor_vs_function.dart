/// Constructor vs. Function
/// Both are methods but has different purpose and distinct characteristics
///
/// 1. Purpose:
///     => Constructor:
///                 Called automatically when object of the class is created.
///                 main purpose is to initialize objects property.
///     => Function:
///                 Block of codes for specific task or operation.
///                 Can be called multiple time.
///
/// 2. Name:
///      => Constructor:
///                  It has the same name as the class.
///      => Function:
///                 It has unique name.
///
/// 3. Calling:
///      => Constructor:
///                  it is called automatically when an object is created.
///      => Function:
///                 user has to call it explicitly.
///
/// 4. Return type:
///      => Constructor:
///                  it doesn't have return type.
///                  They implicitly return the instance of the class they initialize,
///                  but this is not specified explicitly.
///      => Function:
///                 It has explicit return type.
///                 which can be all data types.
