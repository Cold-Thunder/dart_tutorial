/// Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm
/// centered around the concept of objects.
/// it is mainly based of real life entity.
///
/// The main Pillars of OOP:
/// 1.Inheritance: It allows a new class to inherit
///                properties and methods from an existing class.
/// 2.Encapsulation: It helps to restricts direct access to data.
/// 3.Polymorphism: It allows objects of different class
///                 to be treated as objects of common super class
/// 4.Abstraction: Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details
///                and showing only the necessary features of an object.
